# README

This is a fun side project I do in my free time.

It is mostly to realize my fantasy in a game, it might not be any good at all, but still it's mine.

 I try to use good design and provide adequate specs for the code as a demonstration of my expertise

 If you have any idea or inquiry, feel free to drop me an email to thailehuy@gmail.com or just open an issue here
